// Main difference is that multiple occurences of same item is allowed that means
// we can choose a item any number of times.
// Related problems:-
// 1)Rod cutting
// 2)Coin change I (Maximum number of ways)
// 3)Coin change II (Minimum numebr of coins)
// 4)Maximum ribbon cut
// The main use of multiple occurences is that if a item is rejected then it will always be 
// rejected and this process is completed.But if a item is accepted now may be in future
// that may be rejected and hence the process is not complete in just 1 operation
