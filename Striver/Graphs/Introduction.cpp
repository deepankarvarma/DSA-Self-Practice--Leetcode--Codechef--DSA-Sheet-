// Two types of graphs:
// 1. Directed Graphs
// 2. Undirected Graphs
// Directed graphs have directed edges means u->v != v->u whereas in undirected graphs
// u->v ==v->u

// In undirected graphs only degree is there, whereas in directed graphs concept of indegree
// and outdegree is there 

// Sum of all degrees in undirected graph = 2* number of edges 
// In a path we cannot visit a vertex more than once
// A graph is called cyclic if we can reach a  vertex again by traveling.
