// Bipartite graph is a graph that can be coloured using 2 colours such that no two
// adjacent nodes have same colour.
// Any graph having cycle of odd length can never be bipartite.
// Any graph doesn't having any odd length cycle is bipartite.It is not necessary that the cycle length is even
// even if the cycle is absent then also it can be bipartite.
